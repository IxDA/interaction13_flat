The Kano methodology was initially adopted by operations researchers, who added statistical rigor to the question pair results analysis.

The complex uncertainty of scientific research makes it difficult for scientists to share their ideas with non-scientists in ways that encourage real and lasting understanding of the concepts and their implications. Often, scientists rely solely on the strength of empirical evidence as an appeal to reason in public scientific discourse. Unfortunately, while science concerns itself with the objective universe of facts and logic, the rest of the world, where &apos;truthiness' has become an accepted condition of everyday experience, does not operate solely on objective reasoning. From climate change to evolution, vaccines and nuclear power, the science community finds itself on the defensive as shifting perceptions of authority and the narratives that frame scientific communication undermine public understanding of science.
