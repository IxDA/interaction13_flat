With the aim of exploring what makes people tick, Teresa uses video, installation, prose, and performance to expose universal emotions that people are often uncomfortable sharing publicly.

    <div class="biography">
      <p>I&rsquo;ve always been curious about pretty much everything.  My first love was physics, but as I finished my undergraduate physics degree, I discovered that I enjoyed the challenge of communicating as much as researching. After several years in the classroom, designing learning experiences as a physics teacher, I realized my passion was for the design process itself; it turns out I&rsquo;m an experience designer at heart. So now I&rsquo;m studying Communication Planning &amp; Information Design in the School of Design at Carnegie Mellon University. I&rsquo;m currently a second year graduate student, beginning work on a thesis project at the intersection of human centered design and science communication. When I&rsquo;m not designing human-centered experiences or daydreaming about physics, I&rsquo;m probably playing ice hockey, baking vegan cookies, or listening to loud music with unintelligible lyrics.</p>

      <p>Carla Diana enjoys living as close to the near future as possible. In her studio and at the award-winning product innovation firm Smart Design, she works on future-specting projects in areas such as domestic robots, mobile devices and sentient kitchen appliances, combining experience in industrial and interaction design to create solutions that bridge the gap between the physical and the digital. This spring, Carla will launch SVA&rsquo;s first ever &ldquo;Smart Objects&rdquo; course as part of the newly founded Products of Design program. She is the founder of the Smart Interaction Lab, an initiative focused on design explorations in the form of tinkering and hands-on experimentation around topics such as expressive objects, digital making, and presence and awareness. In 2008 the New York Times Magazine called her an &ldquo;alpha geek&rdquo;.</p>

Now, as one of the early pioneers of the service design industry, Andy helps transform the world&rsquo;s biggest brands through innovative design.</p>
      <p>After spending years in the games and interactive television industries, Andy fell in love with mobile, and joined Fjord London as the director of service design.

      <p>Azmina is a hybrid between a designer, researcher, and content strategist. She is a Vancouver native who resides in Boulder, CO as an Experience Designer at Crispin Porter + Bogusky.</p>
      <p>With a background in user research in the mobile phone realm, she never thought she would go into advertising. But the intersection of human-centered design, business and creativity intrigued her and she couldn&apos;t help but satisfy her curiosity. At CP+B, she gets the best of all worlds by conceiving compelling experiences for brands in both digital and physical realms.</p>
      <p>Azmina has a great interest in understanding different demographics, and has presented related work at two conferences so far:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>CSCW 2012 (Computer Supported Collaborative Work), where she presented her findings of the communication practices of older adults.</li>
        <li>IDC 2012 (Interaction Design and Children), where she presented Time-Me, a concept to help young children understand time in a tangible way.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When she&apos;s not enhancing experiences, she&apos;s either singing with her Vancouver and Boulder bands, satisfying her foosball addiction, or eating frozen yogurt.</p>

      <p>I&apos;m a designer, entrepreneur, runner and unschooler living in the amazing city of Toronto, Canada. I have an academic background in environmental planning and impact assessment. I spent most of my time in graduate school trying to figure out whether soft systems theory was the coolest thing ever or the craziest thing ever. It&apos;s both. I spent years focused on getting millions of Americans to apply for "just one more" credit card. It was a dirty job, but the lessons were invaluable.  I started a design firm with an economist. We're making it all up as we go along, which is makes us really good at what we do. I love my job and I get to work with incredible people.  I run 60 miles a week. This means I get to spend a ton of time in deep flow states. I do most of my serious thinking work on my feet.  My wife and I have two daughters. We're unschooling geeks. We believe that the greatest gift you can give a child is the passion and confidence to be a life-long learner.  I&apos;m a student of John Boyd. I design strategic planning tools for fun. I thrive on ambiguity and respect chaos. I believe that life has no stopping rule.</p>

      <p>Rich is dedicated to navigating disruptive change to create shared value for business and society. He makes sense of massive social and economic shifts to develop adaptive strategies and innovative business models for both established businesses and startups. At Claro, we believe that the disruptions that are taking place today are significant opportunities for businesses that are willing to pay attention, understand and act upon them decisively.</p>
      <p>Areas that Rich advises clients on include the shift from ownership to access; dispersed, multiple-sided models of value creation and exchange; the blurring of producer and consumer roles in commercial interactions; moving beyond social media to creating network-based businesses; unlocking the true value of personal data by giving it back to the user; and translating agile, socially negotiated practices from the informal economy to traditional business structures.</p>
      <p>Rich delivers real innovation by developing a deep understanding of people&apos;s needs, desires, routines and hierarchies of values. This understanding leads to service design approaches that create ideal customer experiences along with the necessary internal business processes to support them across the value chain. Based on this flow, it is then possible to create multi-stakeholder business models that disrupt industries and create completely novel value propositions.</p>
      <p>With almost 20 years of experience, Rich has been turning insights into innovative new opportunities, products, services, experiences, development guidelines and business strategies for clients such as BBVA, HP, IBM, Intel, Motorola, Nokia Skype, Sony, Samsung and Telefónica, Time-Warner and Vodafone around the world.</p>

    <div class="biography">
      <p>Peter Stahl has made technology less frustrating at Cisco, eBay, AOL, and a host of startups and clients. A veteran of Silicon Valley, he pioneered some of the first user interfaces for tablets, interactive television and Web conferencing. His designs also touch on network management, e-commerce, enterprise applications, and music. Peter made a splash at Interaction 11 with his provocative and inspiring talk, &ldquo;The Rhythm of Interaction,&rdquo; urging colleagues to design pacing and tempo into increasingly dynamic and cinematic user experiences. His highly-rated talks have been hits at the IA Summit, Web 2.0 Expo, Heartland Developers Conference, IxDA local chapters, and at startups and established companies. A specialist in design patterns, he currently leads application standards for Cisco Services. Earlier innovations include a methodology for Interaction Audits, including a taxonomy for characterizing the &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of a user interface. Recently he contributed a section, &ldquo;The Feel of Searching,&rdquo; to Greg Nudelman&rsquo;s book, "Designing Search."</p>
